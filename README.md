# APP DEVELOPMENT for Bharat Intern internship
As a part of the internship at Bharat Intern, I made 2 programs using JAVA Swing GUI via Eclipse IDE.

## Basic Caluclator
Takes input in JTextField, performs operation and outputs the result in the same JTextField.

- Once input and operation has been selected, the input is initially a String.
- It is converted to int
- Choice of operation is checked with Switch Case
- Second number is inputted
- Calculation occurs and the final result is displayed

## Temperature Convertor app
The graphical interface has two drop down menus with the Units of Temperature mentioned. Corresponding to each drop down menu is a Text Field for input and output

- User sets the Units in both the dropdown menus.
- User input a number and clicks on the CONVERT button
- The Units on the menu are read and the Strings are matched. The corresponding calculations are performed.
- n2 stores the calculated value which is displayed on the OUTPUT JTextField.
